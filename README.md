# Theater App

## About

This was a project done as part of Database Design course (CS 3200 at Northeastern University).

This database stores a list of all movies, list of all theaters, and timings. The application provides functionality to the end user to search for a movie by location of theater and timing (date and time). The application also has admin functionality to add, modify, and delete the repository contents.
